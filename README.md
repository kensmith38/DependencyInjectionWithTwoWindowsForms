This tutorial shows a technique to use Dependency Injection (DI) in a .NET 8 Windows Forms App for two forms (or more).  
It's easy to set up DI for the main form (Form1), but figuring out how to use DI in the 2nd form was difficult.  
During research I saw techniques using "Form Factories" but that seemed too complex.  
So I devised a technique shown in this video that seems very simple.  
Feedback would be appreciated although I may not always respond promptly.  Your feedback may help other viewers even if I don't respond.
